OUTLINE:
The Javascript Grid Editor is a 100% Javascript program that extends the functionality
of CRM Grids by providing a way to edit records and add records, in place, by providing
input elements in the cells of a CRM Grid and relevant functions to write any input
provided to the CRM application via SOAP interaction.

VERSION HISTORY (Major Releases):

1.0	Major Release

	--In this Release--
	All major features and functions are present and in fully operable condition.
	Functions from other projects have been compiled into this program, and are
	developed separately for convenience to myself, and the CRM Community.

	New Features:
	Insert Mode and Edit Mode
		These functions provide the ability to edit or create a record directly 
		into a CRM Grid.  This is limited to single-entity Grids.  Both functions
		only work on records which are in the first, active State available, 
		though the Status Reason has no restriction.

	Default, Restricted, and Disabled inputs
		By specifying special global variables, specified attributes can be
		restricted from receiving a control entirely, have their controls
		populated by default information, or become disabled.

	Feature Enhancements:
		N/A
